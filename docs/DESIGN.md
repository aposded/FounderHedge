# FounderHedge: Zero-Knowledge Success Sharing for Founders

## Overview

FounderHedge is a groundbreaking platform that enables startup founders to create mutual support networks with complete privacy. Through fully encrypted smart contracts and the USDY privacy-preserving stablecoin, founders can participate in a success-sharing pool where all aspects of their participation - from commitment percentages to exit valuations - remain completely private and unobservable on-chain.

### What is a Success Pool?

A success pool is a collaborative financial arrangement where startup founders commit to sharing a percentage of their future exit proceeds with other pool members. The key innovation is that all aspects of participation are fully encrypted:

- Commitment percentages are private
- Exit contributions are untraceable
- Distribution amounts are hidden
- Member identities are shielded
- Transaction values are encrypted

This creates a supportive ecosystem where:

- Successful exits help sustain other founders
- No information about exit size is revealed
- Member identities remain private
- Even the timing of contributions is obscured

## Why FounderHedge?

### The Privacy Challenge

Startup founders face a critical challenge: the desire to participate in mutual support networks while maintaining absolute confidentiality around their success metrics. Traditional systems expose sensitive information:

- Exit valuations become public
- Contribution patterns reveal company health
- Member identities are visible
- Transaction amounts can be traced

### The Zero-Knowledge Solution

FounderHedge solves this through a novel zero-knowledge architecture where:

- All state variables are encrypted
- No transaction details are visible on-chain
- Member identities are shielded
- Even the existence of transactions is private
- Pool administrators cannot view any private information
