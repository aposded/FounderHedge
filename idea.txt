📌 Encrypted Success Pool for Startup Founders 🚀🔐

A Seismic-powered, encrypted income-sharing pool where successful startup founders contribute a percentage of their exit to immediately distribute dividends to other members. This ensures that founders hedge against failure by benefiting from others' success while keeping all values private.

Unlike traditional hedge pools, this is not an insurance or failure-protection mechanism—instead, it's a success-sharing mechanism that creates financial stability for founders in volatile industries.

🛠️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ Founders Join the Encrypted Success Pool 🔗
	•	Startup founders join the pool by committing to share 1-10% of their future successful exits.
	•	No contributions are required upfront—only upon a successful exit.
	•	The list of participants and their obligations remain encrypted, ensuring privacy.
	•	Fixed 30-day join window for each pool.

2️⃣ Founders Exit & Contribute to the Pool 💰
	•	When a founder has an exit, they submit an encrypted report of their earnings.
	•	A smart contract verifies the submission (via an off-chain or ZK-proof mechanism).
	•	The founder pays their committed percentage into the encrypted success pool.
	•	Minimum 7-day interval between contributions.

3️⃣ Immediate Dividend Distribution to Other Members 🎉💵
	•	The pooled exit contributions are automatically distributed to all other members.
	•	Each member receives an encrypted payout based on their commitment percentage.
	•	The distribution is fair and proportional to commitments.
	•	The exact amount received remains hidden to protect privacy.

4️⃣ Continuous Cycle of Contributions & Distributions 🔄
	•	The next successful founder contributes their share.
	•	The cycle repeats, ensuring continuous peer-backed financial stability.
	•	If no members succeed in a given period, nothing happens—there's no obligation to pay.
	•	Members must stay in the pool for at least 90 days after the join window closes.

📜 Smart Contracts Required

To implement this encrypted success-sharing system, we'll need three core smart contracts:

Contract Name	Purpose
SuccessPool.sol	Manages pool entries, tracks commitments, and handles contributions with fixed rules.
ExitContribution.sol	Processes encrypted exit reports, verifies ZK proofs, and distributes funds.
DividendDistributor.sol	Handles the automatic encrypted dividend distribution to members.
