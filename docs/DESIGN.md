# FounderHedge: Privacy-Preserving Success Sharing for Founders

## Overview

FounderHedge is a revolutionary platform that enables startup founders to create mutual support networks while maintaining privacy around their commitments and contributions. By leveraging encrypted smart contracts, founders can participate in a success-sharing pool where their commitment percentages and exit valuations remain confidential.

## Why FounderHedge?

### The Founder's Dilemma

Startup founders face a unique challenge: the desire to support and be supported by fellow entrepreneurs while maintaining confidentiality around their success metrics. Traditional success-sharing arrangements expose sensitive information:

- Exit valuations become public
- Commitment percentages reveal risk appetite
- Contribution timing can signal company health

### The FounderHedge Solution

FounderHedge solves this by creating a privacy-preserving success-sharing pool where:

- Commitment percentages are encrypted on-chain
- Exit valuations remain confidential
- Contribution calculations happen within encrypted smart contracts
- Distribution logic preserves privacy of individual shares

## Core Features

### 1. Privacy-Preserving Commitments

- Founders choose a commitment percentage (1-10%)
- The chosen percentage is encrypted on-chain
- Only the founder can view their own commitment
- Even pool administrators cannot see individual commitments

### 2. Confidential Exit Processing

- Exit contributions use wETH for additional privacy
- The relationship between contribution and exit value remains encrypted
- Smart contracts handle all calculations within an encrypted context
- Other members cannot determine the original exit value

### 3. Fair Distribution System

- Distributions are calculated proportionally to commitments
- Individual shares remain private
- Members receive their share without revealing the amount
- Distribution timing is predictable and transparent

### 4. Membership Rules

- 90-day minimum membership ensures pool stability
- 7-day contribution interval prevents gaming
- Clear eligibility criteria for joining
- Transparent rules enforced by smart contracts
