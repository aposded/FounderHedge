# FounderHedge: Privacy-Preserving Success Sharing for Founders

## Overview

FounderHedge is a revolutionary platform that enables startup founders to create mutual support networks while maintaining privacy around their commitments and contributions. By leveraging encrypted smart contracts and the USDY privacy-preserving stablecoin, founders can participate in a success-sharing pool where their commitment percentages and exit valuations remain confidential.

### What is a Success Pool?

A success pool is a collaborative financial arrangement where startup founders commit to sharing a small percentage of their future exit proceeds (like acquisitions or IPOs) with other pool members. Think of it as founders helping founders:

- When you join, you commit to sharing a small percentage (1-10%) of any future exit
- If your startup has a successful exit, you contribute that percentage to the pool
- The contributed amount is then distributed among all pool members
- In return, you receive a share of other members' exit contributions when they succeed

This creates a supportive ecosystem where:

- Early exits help fund founders still building
- Larger exits provide bigger distributions to the community
- Everyone has aligned incentives for mutual success
- Risk is shared across multiple ventures

For example, if ten founders each commit 5% and one has a $10M exit, they would contribute $500K to the pool, which gets distributed among all members. This way, successful exits help sustain the broader founder community while they work toward their own exits.

## Why FounderHedge?

### The Founder's Dilemma

Startup founders face a unique challenge: the desire to support and be supported by fellow entrepreneurs while maintaining confidentiality around their success metrics. Traditional success-sharing arrangements expose sensitive information:

- Exit valuations become public
- Commitment percentages reveal risk appetite
- Contribution timing can signal company health

### The FounderHedge Solution

FounderHedge solves this by creating a privacy-preserving success-sharing pool where:

- Commitment percentages are encrypted on-chain
- Exit valuations remain confidential
- Contribution calculations happen within encrypted smart contracts
- Distribution logic preserves privacy of individual shares

## Core Features

### 1. USDY Token Integration

- Privacy-preserving USD-pegged stablecoin (USDY)
- Yield-bearing capabilities through reward multiplier
- Shielded balances and transfers
- Role-based access control for minting and administration
- Built on SRC20 (Shielded ERC20) standard

### 2. Privacy-Preserving Commitments

- Founders choose a commitment percentage (1-10%)
- The chosen percentage is encrypted on-chain
- Only the founder can view their own commitment
- Even pool administrators cannot see individual commitments

### 3. Confidential Exit Processing

- Exit contributions use wETH for additional privacy
- The relationship between contribution and exit value remains encrypted
- Smart contracts handle all calculations within an encrypted context
- Other members cannot determine the original exit value

### 4. Fair Distribution System

- Individual shares remain private
- Members receive their share without revealing the amount
- Distribution timing is predictable and transparent

### 5. Membership Rules

- 90-day minimum membership ensures pool stability
- 7-day contribution interval prevents gaming
- Clear eligibility criteria for joining
- Transparent rules enforced by smart contracts
